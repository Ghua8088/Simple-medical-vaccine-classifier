Preprocessing:
Numerical Representation: Categorical data was converted to numerical values to apply logistic regression.
Removing Low Variance Features: Features with low variance were removed to improve model performance.
Feature Importance: Due to limited domain knowledge, feature importance was assessed by plotting values and analyzing graphs.
Modeling:
Separate Models: Separate models were trained for predicting the xyz vaccine and the seasonal vaccine.
Logistic Regression: Used logistic regression for both models.
ROC and AUC: Implemented ROC and AUC from the Sklearn module to evaluate the models.
Process
Train and Predict:
Separated the target variables (xyz_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine) and trained two logistic regression models.
Predicted twice to obtain probabilities for both vaccines.
Model Evaluation:
Calculated ROC AUC scores to evaluate model performance.
Plotted ROC curves and selected the model with the highest score.
Final Predictions:
Applied the selected model to the test set.
Saved the predictions to a CSV file.
